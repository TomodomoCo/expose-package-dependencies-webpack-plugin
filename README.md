# expose-package-dependencies-webpack-plugin

Inline dependencies from third-party packages which provide a WordPress script dependencies file (`*.deps.json`) as part of your webpack build process.

Pairs well with the `@wordpress/scripts` build utilities.

## Usage

1. `npm install --save-dev github:tomodomoco/expose-package-dependencies-webpack-plugin#master`
2. Add the following to your webpack config:
    ```js
    plugins: [
      ...defaultConfig.plugins,
      new ExposePackageDependenciesWebpackPlugin( {
        packages: [
          'my-package-which-provides-deps-json',
        ]
      } ),
    ],
    ```
3. â€¦
4. Profit! ðŸ’°

## Caveats

The plugin expects that packages which provide a `*.deps.json` file will have a `main` file defined in their `package.json`, and that the deps file will live at the standard location relative to that file (e.g. given `"main": "build/index.js"`, the dependency file should live at `build/index.deps.json`).
